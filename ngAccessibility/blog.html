  The first thing that you NEED to know for the BYU - Idaho Accessibility Site is JavaScript. Luckily it is one of the simplest languages.
  In JavaScript you need to know about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp">Objects</a>, <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies">Promises</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction">API calls</a>.
  After you have a basic understanding of those you will be able to take on Angular.

<h3>Angular</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular.io</a> will be one of your greatest friends when it comes to Angular. That and YouTube. The first thing is you want to do the intruduction Angular Activity.
  Angular is a JavaScript framework. It is based of the idea of a single page website, so that your site loads faster. It was made this way so that if needed, this could go for a while without major rewrites.
  When searching for information about Angular do NOT use information about Angularjs. This is version one of Angular. We use version 6.

<h3>Firebase</h3>
<p>
  We use <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Google Firebase</a> for hosting the Accessibility Site, Cloud Function, and Firestore Database.
  You must have the CLI (Command Line Interface) <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools">tools</a> installed. They can be installed throught the Node.js Packet Manager in the CLI.
</p>
<h4>Firebase Hosting</h4>
<p>
  Firebase hosting gives us two URL's that we can use for the public to access. Both lead to the same <a href="https://byui-accessibility-redemption.web.app/">site</a>.
  We use the CLI (Command Line Interface) to push our current build to the site. This is done through the command firebase deploy --only hosting.
